This is an attempt of Azure Sheep game code recreation.

To implement:
env_spawnereffect
weapon_kmedkit
trigger_die
trigger_katehealth
trigger_sound (not working)
trigger_loadhazard
monster_myself and monster_myself_dead
monster_bodypart (no model in game resources)
monster_garbage (no model in game resources)

To fix:
weapon_toad (incorrectly sound emitting)
monster_archer (working incorrectly)
monster_spforce (weapon_beretta isn't spawning, but should)
monster_worker (he mustn't cure player)
monster_gordon (script of Gordon driving in a car is absent).
